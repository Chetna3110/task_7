 SVM Binary Classification - Breast Cancer Dataset
This project demonstrates how to build a binary classifier using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on a breast cancer dataset. The notebook includes preprocessing, model training (with both Linear and RBF kernels), decision boundary visualization, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Dataset : 
breast-cancer.csv

Binary classification (e.g., benign vs malignant)

Includes several numerical features and a target label
 
 
 Objectives :
Load and prepare the dataset

Train SVM models with linear and RBF kernels

Visualize decision boundaries using 2D PCA

Tune hyperparameters (C, gamma)

Evaluate model using cross-validation
